	content := fmt.Sprintf(`## Live Source Debug Session

You are debugging a **%s** program from source.%s

**Program path:** `+"`"+`%s`+"`"+`

---

### Step 1: Start the debug session

Call: `+"`"+`debug(mode="%s", path="%s", debugger="%s")`+"`"+`
%s
Expected output: The debugger starts and either stops at entry or waits at a breakpoint. You will see a stack trace and local variables.

**If the debug tool fails:**
- Check that `+"`"+`%s`+"`"+` is installed and in `+"`"+`$PATH`+"`"+`
- For Go: ensure the path points to a .go file or directory with a `+"`"+`main`+"`"+` package
- For C/C++: compile with -g -O0 first, then use binary mode

---

### Step 2: Set strategic breakpoints

Before running, identify the most useful locations:
- Entry points to the function or logic area of interest
- Error handling paths
- State transitions

Call: `+"`"+`breakpoint(file="/abs/path/to/file", line=N)`+"`"+`
Or by function: `+"`"+`breakpoint(function="packageName.FunctionName")`+"`"+`

---

### Step 3: Run to the first interesting point — **two-step pattern**

`+"`"+`continue`+"`"+` is non-blocking (v0.2.0+): it returns immediately with a "running" status JSON. To receive the stop event, call `+"`"+`wait-for-stop`+"`"+` next.

Call: `+"`"+`continue()`+"`"+`
Then call: `+"`"+`wait-for-stop(timeoutSec=30, pauseIfTimeout=true)`+"`"+`

Expected: `+"`"+`wait-for-stop`+"`"+` returns full context when the program hits
the breakpoint. With `+"`"+`pauseIfTimeout=true`+"`"+`, a pause is issued on timeout
and the current stopped context is returned so you can inspect where the
program got stuck.

Output includes:
- **Location**: file, line, function name
- **Stack trace**: full call chain
- **Variables**: locals and their current values

**When to use a subagent:** if the breakpoint needs an external trigger
(HTTP request, browser navigation) that may take > 60s, dispatch
`+"`"+`wait-for-stop`+"`"+` to a subagent via the Agent tool so your main agent can
issue the trigger in parallel.

**What to look for:**
- Are variable values what you expect at this point?
- Is the call stack reasonable, or is something unexpected calling this function?

---

### Step 4: Inspect state

Call: `+"`"+`context()`+"`"+` at any time to refresh the current location, stack, and variables.

Call: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="variableName")`+"`"+` to inspect specific values:
- Struct fields: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="user.Address.City")`+"`"+`
- Slice/array elements: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="items[0]")`+"`"+`
- Computed expressions: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="len(queue)")`+"`"+`

---

### Step 5: Step through logic

- `+"`"+`step(mode="over")`+"`"+` — execute current line, staying in the same function
- `+"`"+`step(mode="in")`+"`"+` — step into a function call
- `+"`"+`step(mode="out")`+"`"+` — run until the current function returns

**Decision guide:**
- See an unexpected value? Step _in_ to the function that produced it
- At a line that doesn't matter? Step _over_ it
- Deep in a call you don't care about? Step _out_

---

### Step 6: Check threads (if concurrent program)

Call: `+"`"+`info(kind="threads")`+"`"+`

Look for: goroutines/threads in unexpected states, goroutines blocked on channels or mutexes.

---

### Step 7: Identify the root cause

By now you should be able to answer:
1. What is the actual (incorrect) value, and where did it come from?
2. What condition or code path led to this state?
3. Is this a logic error, a missing nil check, an off-by-one, a race condition, or something else?

State your findings clearly: **"The bug is at [file:line]. [Variable] has value [X] when it should be [Y] because [reason]."**

---

### Step 8: Clean up

	pid := req.Params.Arguments["pid"]

	if program != "" {
		programDesc = fmt.Sprintf("\n**Program description:** %s\n", program)

**Target PID:** `+"`"+`%s`+"`"+`

> **Important:** The process continues running after you attach. You are observing live state.
> Be careful: setting breakpoints in a production process will pause it for all users.

---

### Step 1: Attach to the process

Two sub-cases of attach — pick the one matching your setup:

**(a) LOCAL attach by PID:**
Call: `+"`"+`debug(mode="attach", processId=%s)`+"`"+`

**(b) PRE-CONNECTED (remote k8s via ConnectBackend):**
If this mcp-dap-server was started with `+"`"+`--connect`+"`"+` / `+"`"+`DAP_CONNECT_ADDR`+"`"+` (the wrapper script `+"`"+`dlv-k8s-mcp.sh`+"`"+` does this automatically), the remote dlv in the pod already owns the target. Call:
`+"`"+`debug(mode="attach")`+"`"+` — no processId, no port.

If you cannot tell which sub-case applies: try (b) first; if you get `+"`"+`processId is required for attach mode`+"`"+` the setup is (a) and you need the PID.

Expected (both sub-cases, v0.2.1+): the call returns immediately with a readiness message. The debuggee is already running; no stop event will arrive until a breakpoint is hit by an external trigger.

**If attach fails:**
- Sub-case (a): verify the PID, check `+"`"+`ptrace_scope`+"`"+` (`+"`"+`cat /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope`+"`"+`), try with elevated permissions, confirm the process hasn't exited.
- Sub-case (b): tail `+"`"+`/tmp/mcp-dap-server.<ns>-<svc>.latest.log`+"`"+` — the startup banner should read `+"`"+`ConnectBackend mode, target localhost:NNNNN`+"`"+`. If it's missing, you're accidentally in (a); ask the operator.

---

### Step 2: Understand what the process was doing

Immediately after attach, call: `+"`"+`context()`+"`"+`

Look for:
- **Current location**: What function/file is it in?
- **Stack trace**: What sequence of calls led here?
- **Variables**: What are the current local values?

If the process was in a system call or blocking operation, the stack will show that.

---

### Step 3: Check all threads

Call: `+"`"+`info(kind="threads")`+"`"+`

This is especially important for concurrent programs. Look for:
- Threads blocked on the same mutex (potential deadlock)
- Threads in unexpected functions
- Unexpectedly high thread counts

For each suspicious thread, inspect it:
Call: `+"`"+`context(threadId=<ID>)`+"`"+`

---

### Step 4: Set targeted breakpoints (carefully)

Only set breakpoints if you have a specific hypothesis to test.

Call: `+"`"+`breakpoint(function="packageName.FunctionName")`+"`"+`

Then resume (non-blocking): `+"`"+`continue()`+"`"+`
And wait for the breakpoint: `+"`"+`wait-for-stop(timeoutSec=60, pauseIfTimeout=true)`+"`"+`

The process resumes; `+"`"+`wait-for-stop`+"`"+` returns full context when the
breakpoint is hit. Inspect state at that point.

---

### Step 5: Diagnose the issue

Common attach scenarios and what to look for:

**High CPU usage:**
- Pause several times with `+"`"+`pause()`+"`"+` + `+"`"+`context()`+"`"+`
- Which function keeps appearing in the stack? That's likely the hot path.
- Look for tight loops, repeated work, or missing caches.

**Memory leak:**
- Check variables for large collections, caches without eviction, or accumulating slices.
- Use `+"`"+`evaluate()`+"`"+` to check sizes: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="len(cache)")`+"`"+`

**Deadlock / hang:**
- All threads should show where they're blocked
- Look for goroutines stuck in channel operations or mutexes
- Check if any goroutine holds a lock that another is waiting for

**Unexpected behavior:**
- Set a breakpoint at the function exhibiting the behavior
- Inspect inputs and internal state

---

### Step 6: Conclude and detach

State your findings: **"The process is [doing X] because [reason]. The issue is [description]."**

To **terminate** the process: `+"`"+`stop()`+"`"+`
To **detach** (leave the process running): `+"`"+`stop(detach=true)`+"`"+`

> Use detach when you want to observe without disrupting the process long-term.

You are analyzing a **crash captured in a core dump**. Execution is frozen at the moment of the crash — you cannot step forward, but you have full access to the crashed state.

**Program:** `+"`"+`%s`+"`"+`
**Core dump:** `+"`"+`%s`+"`"+`
**Debugger:** %s

> This is read-only analysis. You cannot change execution — only observe the crashed state.

---

### Step 1: Start the core dump session

Call: `+"`"+`debug(mode="core", path="%s", coreFilePath="%s", debugger="%s")`+"`"+`

Expected: The debugger loads the core dump and positions at the crash frame. You will see the crash location, stack trace, and local variables.

**If loading fails:**
- Ensure the binary matches the core dump exactly (same build, not rebuilt after crash)
- Check file paths are absolute and readable
- For Go: ensure Delve is installed (`+"`"+`dlv version`+"`"+`)
- For C/C++: ensure GDB 14+ is installed (`+"`"+`gdb -i dap`+"`"+`)

---

### Step 2: Understand the crash location

Call: `+"`"+`context()`+"`"+`

This is your most important call. Look for:
- **Crash function**: What function was executing when the crash occurred?
- **File and line**: Exact source location of the crash
- **Local variables**: What values were present at the crash frame?
- **Stack trace**: The full call chain leading to the crash
%s

---

### Step 3: Examine the crash frame variables

Look at every variable in the crash frame:
- Are any pointers nil? A nil dereference causes SIGSEGV.
- Are indices within bounds? Out-of-bounds access can cause SIGSEGV.
- Are any values nonsensical (e.g., negative size, huge number)? Suggests corruption.

Use `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="varName")`+"`"+` to inspect variables not shown in context, or to drill into nested fields:
- `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="err.Error()")`+"`"+`
- `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="request.Body")`+"`"+`
- `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="items[idx]")`+"`"+`

---

### Step 4: Walk up the call stack

Each frame in the stack trace tells part of the story. For each suspicious frame:

1. Use `+"`"+`context(frameId=<N>)`+"`"+` to inspect variables in that frame
2. Look for: what argument was passed to the crashing function? Was it already invalid?
3. Ask: could the caller have passed a nil/invalid value?

Work backwards from the crash until you find where the bad value originated.

---

### Step 5: Check other threads / goroutines

Call: `+"`"+`info(kind="threads")`+"`"+`

In multi-threaded programs, the crash may be triggered by another thread's action (race condition). Look for:
- Other threads at suspicious locations
- Threads that may have corrupted shared state

For each interesting thread: `+"`"+`context(threadId=<ID>)`+"`"+`

---

### Step 6: Formulate your conclusion

Answer these questions:
1. **What crashed?** (function, file, line)
2. **Why did it crash?** (nil pointer, invalid index, assertion failure, etc.)
3. **What bad value caused it?** (which variable, what value it had)
4. **Where did that bad value come from?** (trace back through the call stack)
5. **What is the root cause?** (missing nil check, logic error, race condition, etc.)

**Pattern recognition:**
- `+"`"+`SIGSEGV`+"`"+` on field access → check if the containing struct pointer is nil
- `+"`"+`SIGSEGV`+"`"+` in memory allocation → heap corruption (often from earlier use-after-free)
- `+"`"+`SIGABRT`+"`"+` in Go → runtime panic (check the panic message in variables)
- `+"`"+`SIGABRT`+"`"+` in C → double-free, assert(), or explicit abort()
- Very deep stack → infinite recursion (check for missing base case)
- Stack frame count = 1 in a goroutine → goroutine was running C code or in a syscall

	content := fmt.Sprintf(`## Binary / Assembly-Level Debug Session

You are debugging a **compiled binary without source context**. You will work primarily with disassembled instructions, registers, and memory addresses.

**Binary:** `+"`"+`%s`+"`"+`

> %s

---

### Step 1: Start the binary debug session

Call: `+"`"+`debug(mode="binary", path="%s", stopOnEntry=true)`+"`"+`

Using `+"`"+`stopOnEntry=true`+"`"+` pauses immediately so you can orient yourself before execution proceeds.

Expected: The debugger stops at the binary entry point or `+"`"+`main`+"`"+`. You will see the current instruction address and possibly a stack trace.

---

### Step 2: Get your bearings

Call: `+"`"+`context()`+"`"+`

Even without source, this shows:
- **Current location**: function name and address (e.g., `+"`"+`main.main at 0x004012a0`+"`"+`)
- **Stack trace**: the call chain with instruction pointer addresses
- **Variables**: any debug info that exists in the binary

Note the `+"`"+`instructionPointerReference`+"`"+` (memory address) from the stack trace — you will use this for disassembly.

---

### Step 3: Disassemble around the current location

Call: `+"`"+`disassemble(address="0x<instructionPointerReference>", count=30)`+"`"+`

Read the assembly output:
- Identify the instruction sequence (what is the function doing?)
- Look for `+"`"+`call`+"`"+` instructions (function calls)
- Look for `+"`"+`cmp`+"`"+`/`+"`"+`test`+"`"+` + conditional jumps (branch logic)
- Look for `+"`"+`mov`+"`"+` with memory operands (data access)

---

### Step 4: Set breakpoints by address or function

By function name (if debug symbols exist):
Call: `+"`"+`breakpoint(function="main.processRequest")`+"`"+`

By address (no symbols needed):
Call: `+"`"+`breakpoint(function="*0x00401234")`+"`"+`

> For GDB: you can use `+"`"+`*0xADDR`+"`"+` syntax to break at an absolute address.

---

### Step 5: Step through assembly

Use `+"`"+`step(mode="in")`+"`"+` to step one instruction at a time (at assembly level, each step may be one machine instruction).

After each step, call `+"`"+`context()`+"`"+` to see the new instruction pointer location.

**What to track:**
- Register values (available via `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="$rax")`+"`"+` in GDB sessions)
- Memory at specific addresses: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="*(int*)0xADDR")`+"`"+`
- Stack pointer and frame pointer movement

---

### Step 6: Inspect memory and registers

Call: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="$rsp")`+"`"+` — current stack pointer
Call: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="$rip")`+"`"+` — current instruction pointer
Call: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="$rax")`+"`"+` — return value register (x86-64)

For memory: `+"`"+`evaluate(expression="*(long*)0x<address>")`+"`"+`

**Calling convention reminders (x86-64 System V):**
- Function args: rdi, rsi, rdx, rcx, r8, r9 (in order)
- Return value: rax
- Preserved: rbx, rbp, r12-r15
- Scratch: rax, rcx, rdx, rsi, rdi, r8-r11

---

### Step 7: Use disassembly to understand logic

When you see a branch or call you want to understand:
1. Disassemble the target: `+"`"+`disassemble(address="0x<target>", count=40)`+"`"+`
2. Set a breakpoint there, then `+"`"+`continue()`+"`"+` followed by `+"`"+`wait-for-stop(…)`+"`"+`
3. Inspect register/memory state at that point

**Common patterns:**
- `+"`"+`call malloc`+"`"+` → memory allocation; check return in rax for NULL
- `+"`"+`test rax, rax; je`+"`"+` → null check
- `+"`"+`cmp [rsp+N], 0; jle`+"`"+` → bounds or sign check
- `+"`"+`rep stos`+"`"+` → memset-like loop

---

### Step 8: Formulate findings

After analysis, state:
1. **What the binary does** at the function/address of interest
2. **Where the issue is** (address, instruction, logic)
3. **What the expected vs actual behavior is**
